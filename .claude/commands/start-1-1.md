# Lesson 1.1: Welcome & Setup

Read the lesson content from `lesson-modules/1-foundations/1-1-welcome-setup.md` and guide the student through it.

## Lesson Flow

### 1. Welcome (2 min)
Greet the student and explain what they'll learn in this course. Set expectations.

### 2. Socratic Opener
Ask: "Before we dive in—what does 'production ML' mean to you? What makes it different from training a model in a notebook?"

Build on their answer to introduce the core challenge: most ML projects fail in production because training and deploying are fundamentally different problems.

### 3. Environment Check (10 min)
Walk them through verifying their setup:
- Python 3.9+
- Docker
- Git
- VS Code (or preferred editor)

Have them run verification commands and troubleshoot any issues.

### 4. Project Introduction (5 min)
Explain the core project: building a sentiment classifier for customer feedback. Show the project structure.

### 5. First Interaction
Have them explore the `project/` directory and ask questions about the structure.

### 6. Wrap Up
- Summarize what was covered
- Preview Lesson 1.2 (MLOps Principles)
- Suggest: "Run `/start-1-2` when you're ready to continue"

## Teaching Notes
- This is their first interaction—set the right tone
- Be encouraging but not condescending
- Let them drive the pace
